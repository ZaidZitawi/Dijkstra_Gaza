# Optimized Dijkstra's Algorithm for Maps

## Overview
This project implements an optimized version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm tailored for geographic maps. It's designed to efficiently handle numerous shortest-path, making it ideal for GIS applications, including navigation systems.

## Features
- Efficient shortest path calculation between two cities.
- Optimization for map-based graphs with minimized space requirements.
